DG-Uncheckable-Radio-button 1.3.0
-------------------

This is a jQuery plugin which improves usability of the standard html radio button control by adding uncheckable behavior to them using some very simple logic which uses javascript (aka jquery). It is possible to do this without using jquery but being jquery the defacto standard for using javascript for the websites now and I am being jquery lover, I just wrote down a pretty simple jquery plugin.
